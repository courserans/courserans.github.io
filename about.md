I started off as a software engineeer with a CAD product development company writing code in C,C++ & Fortran. Somewhere along the way ... I moved into the program management domain. Currently I lead a large team of talented individuals who create multichannel customer experience  at the intersection of technology and User Centred Design. These projects are mostly for some of the most iconic brands of the world. 

It is during one of these projects that I was exposed to Marketing Analytics  and how Data Driven Marketing is disrupting the traditional brand management and marketing domain in general. Curiosity got the better of me and I enrolled myself in the "Data Science Specialization" from Coursera & "Intro to Statistical Learning" from Stanford Online. 

This blog is about my journey of learning R and Data sciences and it's application to Marketing problems. 

Thanks for reading!
